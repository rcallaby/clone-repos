# clone-repos

This is a small ultity program that helps me, or anyone, to clone repositories on github or other websites that use git.

The purpose of this program is quite simple. A quick and easy way for me to clone my repositories to a new Linux system so that I can work on them. This actually solves a minor problem I was having but this issue was taking up valuable time and as such I like to find a way I can get that time back by using software as an aid.

If you found this small ultity program useful please give it a star.
